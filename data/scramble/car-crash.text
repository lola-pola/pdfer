b'Introduction Transcript / Episode Notes\nHello LEPsters, how are you today? The weather here is grey, overcast. The conditions are perfect for recording and listening to an episode of Luke\xe2\x80\x99s English Podcast, so here we go.\n\nIn this episode I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read through some insurance claims, which contain some very funny descriptions of people attempting to explain how they got into accidents while driving. I think it should be pretty amusing and as usual there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of English to learn from it.\n\nSo we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about driving and having accidents, collisions or crashes in a car. Have you ever been in a car crash? What happened? Did you have to do any insurance paperwork afterwards? Did you have to describe what happened in your crash?\n\nIf you have an accident while driving in the UK the insurance company sends you a claim form which you fill in, and often there\xe2\x80\x99s a big space on the back that says \xe2\x80\x9cGive, in your own words, a description of how you think the accident occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo this is where people give their account of the accident.\n\nAnd they always try to make it sound like it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their fault or they weren\xe2\x80\x99t breaking any speed limits.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was driving down the road at 28mph\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese are genuine claim form extracts from real people\xe2\x80\x99s insurance claims.\n\nI have to say that I got inspired to do this episode by Jasper Carrot, a comedian from the 70s, 80s and 90s in the UK.\n\nJasper Carrot (who used to live down the road from me, growing up) used to do a routine about funny insurance claims. He would basically read out the insurance claims on stage and bring them to life, make comments about them and stuff. He said all the claims were all true and I\xe2\x80\x99d always been interested in finding some of those claim forms online, and after doing some searches I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to find loads of those real insurance claims so I\xe2\x80\x99ve selected some and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through them one by one. Some of these are the same ones that Jasper Carrot used to read out in his comedy shows.\n\nThe cool thing about this for learning English is not just that these are really funny and stupid descriptions, it\xe2\x80\x99s that they include moments when the language becomes a bit ambiguous and can mean several things at the same time (like a joke) and also there are descriptions of movements and accidents that contain some nice bits of English.\n\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through all the vocab that comes up as we go along, including a vocab review at the end.\n\nSo if you don\xe2\x80\x99t find these particularly funny, you can at least learn some English from it all.\n\nAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about vocabulary for movements, accidents, collisions and driving, verb tenses for storytelling and all that kind of thing.\n\nJust think about that for a second. How do you describe moments when accidents happen? They\xe2\x80\x99re often quite difficult to describe.\n\nHave you ever had an accident? Can you try to describe exactly what happened in English?\n\nI was in a car accident once. Let me describe it to you.\n\nI did end up with whiplash and I remember making an insurance claim for it, which I never applied for eventually, because I think I only missed about 2 shifts working at the pub and the whole thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem worth it.\n\nAnyway, what about these claims? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\n\nSee if you can notice what is funny or strange about these claims, and also what is happening linguistically which makes it funny. It\xe2\x80\x99s often due to slightly bad writing that these things end up sounding like something else.\n'
